## Changelog
[The changelog](CHANGELOG.md) is updated on [the `dev` branch](https://github.com/MAKENTNU/web/tree/dev) when changes are made to the codebase -
specifically under [the "Unreleased" section](CHANGELOG.md#unreleased).
This section is then renamed to the current date whenever a deployment pull request is merged into
[the `main` branch](https://github.com/MAKENTNU/web/tree/main), and a new, empty "Unreleased" section is added.

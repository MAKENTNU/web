# Changelog

A summary of changes made to the codebase, grouped per deployment.


## Unreleased

### New features

- Added [the `django-constance` package](https://django-constance.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Added [a dynamic setting](https://admin.makentnu.no/constance/config/) for hiding/showing the apply ("SÃ¸k verv") button in the header

### Improvements

- Updated Django to version 4.1
- Place files uploaded through CKEditor in a separate folder for each model
- Made all pages have a consistent (browser tab) title format
  - Most pages will have " | MAKE NTNU" as suffix to the title;
    subpages of the admin panel have " | Admin panel | MAKE NTNU" as suffix
- Replaced the `trans` template tag with `translate`
- Made the `user` field of `Profile` non-nullable
- Added "and employees" to the end of the Open Graph description
  (shown in some search engines and when embedding pages from the website on sites like Facebook)

### Fixes

- Made the CKEditor file uploader work on all subdomains
- Prevented [CSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) against the logout URL,
  by requiring logout requests being sent using `POST` instead of `GET`

### Other changes

- Set minimum required Python version to 3.10
- Changed order of the apps listed on [the Django admin index page](https://admin.makentnu.no/)
- Never-ending masses of code cleanup


## 2022-10-28 ([#567](https://github.com/MAKENTNU/web/pull/567))

### New features

- Added GitHub Actions workflows for automatically adding issues and PRs to [the repo's project](https://github.com/orgs/MAKENTNU/projects/1)
  and setting adequate "Status" and "Date posted" values

### Improvements

- Improved wording and added image links to the emails sent to users after registering for an event
- Emails are printed to console instead of being sent, when testing or debugging

### Fixes

- Fixed event registration emails not being sent
- Fixed wrong comparison of `MultiLingualTextStructure`
- Fixed `ContentBox.get_absolute_url()` not working
- Fixed unable to submit required search select widgets
  - Which are - among other places - used in the "Add New Member" form


## 2022-07-17 ([#478](https://github.com/MAKENTNU/web/pull/478))

### New features

- Added a URL which always links to the current week for a machine reservation calendar
  - This URL can be copied by right-clicking the "View in calendar" button for a machine on [the machine list page](https://makentnu.no/reservation/),
    and selecting "Copy link address"
- Made machine streams work with the new Raspberry Pi setup
  - Also, only the visible streams are connected to;
    once the page is scrolled so that a stream image is no longer rendered, the stream for that machine is disconnected,
    which makes [the machine list page](https://makentnu.no/reservation/) use considerably less data (depending on how the page is scrolled)
    - This does not apply to the machine detail (calendar) page, as there is always only one stream on the page

### Improvements

- Loading the member list has been made slightly faster
- Renamed a lot of templates (and CSS and JavaScript files) to comply with the style guide
- Improved word breaking (splitting a word between two lines, often using a hyphen) multiple places, like in titles and descriptions
- Added translations to the spreadsheet containing course registrations, that can be downloaded from
  [the course registrations page](https://makentnu.no/reservation/course/)
- Improved the permission check for [the admin panel](https://makentnu.no/admin/)
- Added edit and delete buttons on the machine detail (calendar) page
- On the history page for a documentation page (on [docs.makentnu.no](https://docs.makentnu.no/)),
  the current version link is now a permalink to that specific version

### Fixes

- Fixed endless redirect loop when a logged-in user visited a page that required a permission that the user didn't have
- Fixed error messages for multilingual form fields (like the event "Content" field) not showing
- Previously, editing CKEditor fields (like the event "Content" field) did not prevent the user from leaving the page;
  this has now been fixed
- Fixed sometimes being unable to close fullscreen machine streams, when clicking the close ("X") button
- Fixed old page version warning when visiting the URL for a specific documentation page version which is the current version of that page

### Other changes

- Added setup instructions to the project's README file
- Much code cleanup, yes


## 2022-06-07 ([#461](https://github.com/MAKENTNU/web/pull/461))

### New features

- Added table on [the profile page](https://makentnu.no/checkin/profile/) which displays the completion status of all available courses
  - Also, the profile button in the user dropdown is now visible to all users - not just MAKE members
- Added an internal page titled "[The History of MAKE NTNU](https://i.makentnu.no/make-history/)"
  - This can be found under the new "Misc."/"Diverse" dropdown in the header on the internal site
- Added list of contents to [the equipment list](https://makentnu.no/makerspace/equipment/)
- Added a "Notes" field to machines
  - This is only for internal use and is not displayed anywhere - except for in the machine change form itself, naturally
- Added an "Internal" field to machines
  - This makes machines only visible to and reservable by MAKE members
- Added an "Info message" field to machines
  - This is for displaying information that's useful to know before using the machine, e.g. the filament that the 3D printer uses,
    the needle that's currently inserted in the sewing machine, or just the machine's current state/"mood"
- Added an SLA 3D printer machine type, and an "SLA course" checkbox to course registrations
  - SLA 3D printers are always visible to MAKE members, but only visible to other users after they have taken the SLA course
- Added "bulletin boards" for each committee on [the internal site](https://i.makentnu.no/)
  - These can e.g. contain notices, instructions, and links to common resources, and can act as a "hub" for each committee
- Added an `.editorconfig` file, to make it easier to configure a text editor to format code to (roughly) fit the style guide

### Improvements

- Made [secrets](https://i.makentnu.no/secrets/) only use one language
- Made the place/location text of events more visible
  - This will hopefully reduce the number of people who meet at Makerverkstedet for 3D printer courses, because they didn't see the event's location
- Sorted the news-related templates into folders, and refactored the event detail template into multiple sub-templates
- Improved image sizing and text layout in the [equipment](https://makentnu.no/makerspace/equipment/)
  and [article lists](https://makentnu.no/news/articles/)
- Some minor improvements to the layout of the information text, action buttons and stream image on each machine detail page

### Fixes

- Fixed the machine status text times ("Available for X hours, XX minutes") not being translated to Norwegian

### Other changes

- Renamed the "Advanced course" checkbox to "Raise3D course", and renamed the "Special 3D printers" machine type to "Raise3D printers"
  - This reflects the fact that the course in question is only really for Raise3D printers specifically
  - It also reduces the potential for confusion after having added the SLA course / machine type
    (which can technically also be classified as an "advanced" course / "special" machine type)


## 2022-05-20 ([#453](https://github.com/MAKENTNU/web/pull/453))

### New features

- Added a Docker container for development purposes
- Added [changelog](https://github.com/MAKENTNU/web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), issue template and pull request template to
  [our GitHub page](https://github.com/MAKENTNU/web)
- Added button for selecting all shown course registrations
- Added [page for searching through all event participants](https://makentnu.no/admin/news/events/participants/search/)

### Improvements

- Significantly improved page performance when watching streams that fail to connect
  (most notably on [the machine list](https://makentnu.no/reservation/))
- Added warning message when there are gaps between the reservation rules of a machine type
- Reordered [admin panel](https://makentnu.no/admin/) buttons
- The code that reduces the size of uploaded images, now does not use the "reduced" image if it's not actually smaller -
  which could happen with some images

### Fixes

- Fixed server error when users tried to change or delete quotes that they themselves had created
- Fixed a bug that didn't update an end calendar's focused date when changing the date of the start calendar
  (e.g. the start/end time fields on the page for creating a new occurrence for an event)
- Fixed a bug after having selected a time in a calendar popup, which would cause nothing to happen when clicking the input field again
- Fixed server error while reducing the size of an uploaded image that was larger than 2.5 MB
- Fixed server error when uploading an image to an object that had its previous image file deleted - without also updating the database

- Added an [internal page for quotes](https://i.makentnu.no/quotes/)
- Added more info fields to members (Gmail and MAKE email addresses, starting semester at NTNU, and GitHub, Discord and Minecraft usernames)

  - Admins can view this through the Django admin site
- Added translations to [the Django admin site](https://admin.makentnu.no/)
